In the class, I have seen the presentation by Dr. Fernando Maestre based on his article "Signal Appropriation of Explicit HIV Status Disclosure Fields in Sex-Social Apps used by Gay and Bisexual Men." In his presentation, Dr. Fernando Maestre explained what the stigma is, described the classification of stigma, and told about his experiment where people with HIV status. The research described that people with HIV status usually tend to have contact with people without any stigma. However, it is difficult for them to overpass the thought of people majority. The possible reason is that education regarding HIV is not done actively. To avoid such stigma, Dr. Fernando Maestre has designed some flashcards where the participants could write their ideas. Also, I have asked the questions regarding the difference between structural and group stigma and whether it is better to have a specific platform for people with stigma.

Also, I have participated in the Breakout Room where possible problems with privacy from the podcasts and articles have been discussed. I have shared my ideas regarding them, which I have also posted in the PO07.

According to the provided rubric, I would evaluate my participation as 5/5.
