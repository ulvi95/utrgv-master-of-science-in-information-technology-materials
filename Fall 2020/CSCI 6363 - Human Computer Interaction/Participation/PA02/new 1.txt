What is the rate in the percentages? Is it higher than other countries? What is the relation between deaths and income (It is intuitively predictable that the poor is the person, the less chances to get the proper medical service)? What is the relation between deaths and the religion? Were these factors covered?

What is a relation between education level and deaths? I suppose it is too high, but I don't see anything about it yet

"Dr. Altema mentioned that it happened across alls socioeconomic status including education" But what is the proportion between lowest ones and highest ones?
