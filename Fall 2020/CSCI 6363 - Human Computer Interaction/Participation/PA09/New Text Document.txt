This week, I have read the survey "Social signal processing: Survey of an emerging domain". In this survey, the authors provided huge research regarding Social Signal Processing, providing available classification, the difference between the types of emotions, human behavior, etc. Furthermore, the authors claim that in the future, the robots' understanding of Social Signal Processing will be in the first roles, because it allows evaluating human behavior properly and provide the corresponding reaction. However, the authors also provide possible obstacles in this way, which some of them I also want to mention. First of all, the robot might have problems in the recognition of the emotions of people with non-standard facial/body structure. Secondly, at this moment, no robot could recognize the context behind the behavior. Thirdly, how the robot can recognize the members of the activity? For example, in the case, if one person interacts with the robot directly when the other two people are spectating, how the robot can recognize that if these people participating in the chat or not? Solving these issues can significantly improve the speed of designing such robots.

Additionally, I have also discussed the plans regarding our project with the members of our team. We have successfully developed the plan for our project, which we will start in a short time.

According to the provided rubric, I would evaluate my participation as 5/5.
