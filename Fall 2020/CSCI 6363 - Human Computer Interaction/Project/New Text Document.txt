This course involves a collaborative final project requiring students to apply skills and fundamental knowledge gained throughout the semester. Students will work in teams of 3 to 5 to develop a proposal aligned with one of the three core facets of HCI: design, engineering, or research.

Design teams will be expected to develop a high-fidelity prototype of a user interface and evaluations will be oriented toward aesthetics, organization of information, and usability.
Engineering teams will be expected to develop a high-fidelity prototype of software or a low-to-mid-fidelity prototype of a physical system. Evaluations will correspondingly be oriented toward functionality, interactivity, and user experience.
Research teams will be expected to develop a proposed investigation covering extant topical literature and proposed methods (design, measures, execution) and analysis. Evaluations will be oriented toward articulation of the motivation and methodological soundness.

All proposals will be graded in four parts: conceptualization (10 pts), a mid-development report (5 pts), a final design doc (10 pts), and final report (10 pts).
