\begin{enumerate}

\item What could not reduce miss rate?

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

\item Decreasing the number of cache levels
\item Increasing the associativity of cache
\item Increasing the number of cache levels

\end{enumerate}

\item What could reduce miss rate?

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

\item Increasing the number of cache levels
\item Increasing the associativity of cache
\item Increasing the size of cache blocks
\item all of them

\end{enumerate}

\item What could reduce miss rate?

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

\item Decreasing the number of cache levels
\item Small cache size
\item Giving priority to reads before writes

\end{enumerate}

\item What could reduce miss rate?

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

\item Increasing the number of cache levels
\item Increasing the total size of cache.
\item Increasing the size of cache blocks
\item all of them

\end{enumerate}

\item Choose the right word to the place of three dots (\ldots):

A valid bit shows that \ldots:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item A block consists data
\item A block is going to be written
\item A block is not going to be written
\end{enumerate}

\item Choose the right word to the place of three dots (\ldots):

A dirty bit shows that \ldots:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item A block consists data
\item A block doesnâ€™t consist data
\item A block is going to be written
\end{enumerate}

\item Choose the right word to the place of three dots (\ldots):

\ldots shows how often the instruction is executed:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item stall
\item throughput
\item time per instruction
\end{enumerate}

\item Choose the right word to the place of three dots (\ldots):

Inter core i7 L1 cache has \ldots

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item one cache for both data and instruction
\item one cache for data and one cache for instruction
\item two caches for both data and instruction
\end{enumerate}

\item Average Memory Access Time (AMAT) is equal :
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item $ hit \ rate + miss \ rate * miss \ penalty $
\item $ hit \ rate * miss \ rate + miss \ penalty $
\item $ hit \ rate + miss \ rate$
\end{enumerate}

\item Choose the right word to the place of three dots (\ldots):

In Allocate writing (Write-Allocate) \ldots

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item the data is read from RAM and loaded into the cache. Then, cache is updated with CPU instruction and dirty bit is set to 1. Finally, the evicted block is written to RAM.
\item the data is written on through to memory, not being load into cache.
\item the data is written directly to cache and memory immediately.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
